Our family danced a lot. My daughters, Laura and Anne, and I continued to 
dance on every occasion. One favorite memory I have of dancing with Laura and 
Anne was when I took each of them when they were seniors in high school to the 
Daddy Daughter dance. We won both dance competitions! As their father, I have 
tried to provide my daughters with unconditional love, as my Mother provided 
to me, endless emotional and loving support, and good educations and life 
experiences which have helped prepare them for happy and successful adult 
lives. Being a father who is worthy of their love and respect, I consider 
fatherhood a privilege, not an entitlement. In nineteen ninety four, my oldest 
daughter Laura gave me a lovely book, which I still have, entitled "Fathers 
and Daughters." My Father's Day suggestion to every father is to dance with 
your daughters at every opportunity. It will not only bring you closer, 
it will give them memories of you “to hang onto" long after we are gone.
