When my husband and I are at dinner, he will gesture to something on the 
table and say, "Finish your food" and I will respond, "I can't, I'll never 
get married." That always makes him laugh and say, "So what have these 
last six years been?" But for me it is something special that I will carry 
around with me something that is my family. My brother remembers the 
phrase and he admits that in his dating days he did watch to see if any of 
the girls would take the last piece of pie or pizza. I think he fell in 
love with his fiance because she would eat whatever she wanted to and 
do not worry about anyone judging her for it. As I embark on starting 
my own family, I wonder what I will tell my daughter. Will I encourage 
her to finish every last piece? Or will I continue to the legacy of my 
mother and tell her not eat the last piece lest she not get married? 
Will she one day laugh to her girlfriends about her mother leaving one 
granola bar, one piece of cheese, or one rice cake alone in their bags?
