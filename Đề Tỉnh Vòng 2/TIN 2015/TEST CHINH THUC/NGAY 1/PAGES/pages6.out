I was born to dance. I've been dancing all my life, ever since my mother, who 
gave up a dancing career on the stage when she married my father, picked me 
up and twirled me around as an infant. As much as I loved dancing with her, 
her greatest gift to me was her "unconditional love" during her lifetime. My 
parents divorced after only five years of marriage, but my father remarried 
a lovely lady who also loved to dance. They used to take me to a dancing 
club where I would listen to the music and watch them dance occasionally my 
stepmother, Mary, invited me to dance. I also met my wife, Charlotte, in a 
dancing party. I danced with her for about fifteen minutes, and during that 
brief span, I realized that I fell in love with her. We kept dancing throughout 
our marriage. My earliest memories of dancing with my daughters started when I 
came home from work to our small home in Marblehead, Massachusetts, and my 
daughter Laura was about three years old. It was very relaxing for me. to turn 
on the record player, pick up Laura in my arms, and dance her around the room!
