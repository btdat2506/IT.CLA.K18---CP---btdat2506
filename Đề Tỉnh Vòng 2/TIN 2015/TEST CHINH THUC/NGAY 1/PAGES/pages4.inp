Every
family
has
its
quirks.
Mine
is
no
different.
I
was
born
in
an
Italian
American
family
in
nineteen
seventy
three.
We
follow
the
classic
stereotype.
My
father
works
and
my
mother
stays
home
with
the
kids.
There
are
certain
things
that
we
remember
from
our
childhood:
phrases,
jokes,
movies.
But
one
piece
of
advice
that
sticks
with
me
from
an
early
age
comes
from
my
mother.
"Don't
finish
your
food
or
you
will
never
get
married."
It
was
an
illogical
jump
from
the
idea
that
a
"lady"
is
not
a
glutton
and
therefore
will
not
finish
the
food
on
her
plate
or
take
the
last
cookie
off
of
the
platter.
A
"lady"
especially
a
young
lady
must
never
appear
hungry.
If
she
did,
she
would
not
be
an
ideal
candidate
for
a
wife.
